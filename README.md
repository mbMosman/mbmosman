## Woot! Nice to meet you. I'm Mary.

With almost 20 years in tech behind me, I'm hanging up my tech hat and moving on to better things in life. I've decided to remove my stuff from GitHub as well, but wanted to leave my account as a little mark that I was once here. If you come across this and we worked together or you were a student of mine, I hope you're happy and remember me fondly, perhaps picturing me relaxing in my garden, reading a book, or perhaps cuddled up with a cat.
