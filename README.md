## Woot! Nice to meet you. I'm Mary.

With over 15 years in software engineering behind me, I've gathered a wealth of technical expertise and experience across the ever-changing tech scene. After years of coding in the industry, I branched out into tech education, spending time teaching and designing courses for both public education and coding bootcamps. Refreshed and with a new perspective, I'm ready to swing back into development, eager to leverage my mentoring and leadership experience on a project team.

I'm always pushing boundaries and embracing new challenges, on the clock and off. Outside of tech, I have a love of languages and maps. I'm always plotting out new adventures, real or imaginary. While I long to travel the _real_ world someday, for now, Iâ€™m more likely to be journeying through imaginary places from books, games, or anime, or perhaps dreaming up some cool new place from my own imagination.

Keen to collaborate or share ideas? Letâ€™s turn our creative sparks into something real.

### About me in 3 (non-tech) bullets:
- 100% :cat: over :dog: (With my partner, we've got a 4 cat, 1 dog family.)
- My first choice for genuine free time is creating fantasy world maps.(ðŸ˜­ Currently blocked by a solid backlog of home DIY projects.)
- I am a :rice_ball: in the fruit basket, and I'm OK with that.(Everything *important* about life I learned from Fruits Basket.)
