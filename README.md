## Woot! Nice to meet you. I'm Mary.

My degree is in Russian Language (which I’ve long since forgotten how to speak), but my career has been spent in tech.  I’ve worked as a web application developer for 20+ years, but teaching is what excites me most.  I’ve taught people of all ages through formal classes and informal meet-ups and code camps. Outside of tech, I have a love of languages and maps. While I long to travel the real world some day, for now I’m more likely to be journeying through imaginary places from books, games, or anime or perhaps dreaming up some cool new place from my own imagination. 

### About me in 3 (non-tech) bullets:
- 100% :cat: over :dog: (My three cats rule my world.)
- My first choice for genuine free time is creating fantasy world maps. I don't have that time now, as I have a HUGE list of home improvement projects.)
- I am a :rice_ball: in the fruit basket, and I'm OK with that.(Everything *important* about life I learned from Fruits Basket.)
