## Woot! Nice to meet you. I'm Mary.

I'm a Software Engineer & Instructor, currently teaching at [Prime Digital Academy](http://primeacademy.io) in Minneapolis, MN. Over the years, Iâ€™ve done web development at companies throughout the Twin Cities, but teaching is what I'm passionate about. I enjoy teaching people of all ages the joy of programming.

### About me in 3 (non-tech) bullets:
- 100% :cat: over :dog: (My three cats rule my world.)
- My first choice for genuine free time is creating fantasy world maps.
- I am a :rice_ball: in the fruit basket, and I'm OK with that.(Everything *important* about life I learned from Fruits Basket.) 

### What I'm currently learning

- Gatsby & Next as React options for a blog update
- Kyudo with [MN Kyudo Renmei](https://www.mnkyudo.org/)
- Japanese - 170+ day DuoLingo streak.
